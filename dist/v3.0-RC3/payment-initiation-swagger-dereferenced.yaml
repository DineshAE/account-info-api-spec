                  creditor's reference or payment remittance identification
                  should be quoted in the end-to-end transaction identification.

                          Usage: The end-to-end identification can be used for
                          reconciliation or to link tasks relating to the
                          transaction. It can be included in several messages

                          Usage: the  instruction identification is a point to

                              Usage: If available, the initiating party should
                              provide this reference in the structured
                              remittance information, to enable reconciliation

                          Usage: The end-to-end identification can be used for

                    the instructed party to refer to the individual instruction.
                    It can be included in several messages related to the
                    instruction.

                    All dates in the JSON payloads are represented in ISO 8601

                    Usage: If available, the initiating party should provide
                    this reference in the structured remittance information, to
                    enable reconciliation by the creditor upon receipt of the

                    reference or a payment remit identification, and only one

                    creditor's reference or payment remittance identification
                    should be quoted in the end-to-end transaction
                    identification.
